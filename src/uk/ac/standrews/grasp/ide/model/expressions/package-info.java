/**
 * Helper classes for parsing Grasp expressions.
 * 
 * <p>In the Grasp model, all values are represented as ExpressionModel-s. To allow the user to edit the
model in the property editor, the IDE must have its own expression parser. ExpressionPars is the
public face of the expression-parsing API. The package may also include additional helper classes.</p>
