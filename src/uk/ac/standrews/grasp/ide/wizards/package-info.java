/**
 * Wizards for creating resources and helper classes.
 * 
 * The wizards package contains two key components:
<ul>
<li>Wizards for creating a new project and adding a new file to the project</li>
<li>Simple API for sample files</li>
</ul>
The modelling software is strict to the UML specification and does now allow for describing Java
enumerations, which can inherit interfaces. This, GraspExamples should be a Java enumeration, and
not a regular class. Every example should be an enumeration value.
The package also contains the wizard pages classes, along with any helper and utility classes that are
useful for building the wizards UI.
